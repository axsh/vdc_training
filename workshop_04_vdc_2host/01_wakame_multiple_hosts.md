# Exercise: Wakame-vdc on multiple hosts

## Goals

* Learn how to setup Wakame-vdc with multiple HVA hosts

## Assignment

We are going to add a second HVA to our Wakame-vdc setup. When we start instances, collector will decide which HVA they are started on. By default this is the HVA that is currently being used the least.

When we're done with the exercise, we will have an environment similar to this image.
